                <p class="lead"><strong>Overview</strong></p>
                <p class="lead">At ArcSystemSolutions, our focus is on attracting and retaining talented individuals who meet our company's business needs. Irrespective of the position held in the company, we pride ourselves in employing <q>Champion</q> people, who love their job and not only sees it as a career, but also an extension of who they are.

                <p class="lead">Our recruitment process focuses primarily on sourcing individuals with a certain predefined character trait (which is very difficult to teach) and secondly on sound business and technology experience.

ArcSystemSolutions follows a rigorous competency based interview process, which may include panel as well as individual interviews. For most key positions, psychometric testing may be included as part of our selection process.</p>
                <p class="lead">Unlike most contract houses who maintain a CV database of individuals they believe have the potential to meet their business requirements at some point in the future; ArcSystemSolutions will offer immediate employment to all applicants that meet our selection criteria.</p>

                <p class="lead">We also accept that the imbalances of the past needs to be addressed and ArcSystemSolutions are in the planning stages of starting a training academy for previously disadvantaged South Africans. A unique recruitment process will be followed to identify individuals that show potential for making a success of a career in SAP<sup>&reg;</sup>. The expected outcome will be individuals that are equipped with enough SAP<sup>&reg;</sup> skills to be employable in an ever growing market.</p>
                <p class="lead"><strong>Maximising our company’s human potential:</strong></p>
                <p class="lead">At ArcSystemSolutions, we are committed to the continues development of all our employees and in the process, we draw, retain and develop the industry’s most talented <q>Champion</q> people.</p>
