                <h2>Custom Archive Solutions</h2>
                <p class="lead"><q>The Best-Run Businesses Run SAP<sup>&reg;</sup></q> would possibly also suggest that these businesses run a unique SAP<sup>&reg;</sup> environment and that custom development may have resulted in fast growing custom tables.</p>
                <p class="lead">For this reason the ArcSystemSolutions D-team, spend their days developing <strong>custom archive solutions</strong> that are tailor made for each client’s individual archiving requirements.</p>
                <p class="lead">On the one hand <strong>z-tables</strong> get archived with a custom archiving object, but on the other hand, the business processes followed by the client may require a pre-processing program or a BAdI to be developed for standard archiving objects. An example may be where a client wishes to archive only those material documents with archiving object MM_MATBEL where the financial document has been finalised according to their predefined business rules. Whether best business practice or not is not for us to question, but there are clients that wish to retain the option to reverse or make adjustments to certain purchase orders or financial documents many years (as much as 8) back. For this they would require the material document to not have been archived.</p>
                <p class="lead">Can data that has been archived, be reloaded into the system? Technically it is possible yes, but we have to consider the following: Can the data be completely reconstructed? Does the data still comply with the current Customizing? Has the data in the database been changed in the intervening period? Has there been a release upgrade since the data was archived?</p>
                <p class="lead">What distinguishes ArcSystemSolutions is having the ability to <strong>visually present</strong> an archiving object to business and to be able to <strong>ask the <q>right questions</q></strong> as the complete picture unfolds. Many a times, the IT departments are not even fully aware of the complete business processes or future intentions and it becomes a learning curve for all, bringing business and IT together with a sometimes first encounter of common understanding.</p>
