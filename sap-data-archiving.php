                <h2>SAP<sup>&reg;</sup> Data Archiving</h2>
                <p class="lead"><q>Data archiving is no longer regarded as a separate, isolated data management method, but instead as a fundamental pillar of <em data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Information Lifecycle Management is a combination of processes with the objective to provide the right piece of information in the right place at the right time. (Data creation, being processed and changed, to be being archived and then later destroyed.)">Information Lifecycle Management (ILM)</em> – the holistic concept that integrates all data that exists within a company.</q> – SAP PRESS</p>
                <p class="lead"><em data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="External storage, from where archived data is accessible in a read only and archived state.">SAP<sup>&reg;</sup> Data Archiving</em> should ideally form part of every SAP<sup>&reg;</sup> implementation, from as early as the planning stages, in order to ensure an optimised system from day one. The reality however is that many companies are too eager to get started with their new SAP<sup>&reg;</sup> implementation and archiving is forgotten until a few years down the line when performance has degenerated, copies and backups are taking longer and money is being wasted on expensive database storage.</p>
                <p class="lead">ArcSystemSolutions conducts a detailed database analysis as a first step of the Archive Project. The report is then used to discuss and implement the archive project roadmap.</p>
                <p class="lead">For every <em data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="The archiving object defines the unit that can be archived and deleted as a whole in the database and represents a business object that has been enhanced to include the components required for data archiving.">Archiving object</em> we have to consider whether <em data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="There are cases where data is automatically created as a SAP standard, but may not be required for a specific installation. The generation of this data, if not used, should be stopped.">Data Prevention</em> is an option, discuss with business the most suitable Residence periods by document type, decide between Deleting and Archiving of data that has reached its residence, understand the legal requirements for the <em data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="The retention period is the period that archived data remains on the archive server, before being permanently deleted.">Retention period</em> and lastly define a <em data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="After retention period has been reached, the destruction policy will define the agreed method to be used for destroying this data on the archive server.">Destruction policy</em>.</p>
                <p class="lead">After all customizing and configuration is in place, object archiving is automated. ArcSystemSolutions Support Team receives notification and results of all archiving activities and uses this information to generate valuable statistics which in turn is used not only as a monitoring tool but more importantly as an early guidance tool for optimization strategies that may be required during the project. These include, but are not limited to, building partitioned info structures and developing custom archiving objects where needed.</p>
                <p class="lead">ArcSystemSolutions Support Team further operates a 24 hour call centre for our customers who may experience difficulty retrieving archived data. Our aim is to ensure uninterrupted access to all archived data at all times.</p>
