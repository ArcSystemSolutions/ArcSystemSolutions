                <h2>SAP HANA<sup>&reg;</sup> Archiving</h2>
                <p class="lead">As we move into a new era of in-memory computing with SAP HANA<sup>&reg;</sup>, we will receive performance results on large volumes of data, unheard of before. The SAP HANA<sup>&reg;</sup> platform has the capability to bring terabytes of complete databases into memory and provide customers with real time analysis of speeds of 10 000 and even 15 000 times faster.</p>
                <p class="lead">The question now is whether SAP<sup>&reg;</sup> Data Archiving still has a place in this super-fast SAP<sup>&reg;</sup> environment and the answer is a definite yes.</p>
                <p class="lead">The archiving approach may shift a little, but legal requirements will remain, in-memory storage will for a while still be expensive and it will always make sense to move data that is no longer required, to cheaper and secure storage. Remember that archiving places data in a read only state on an external server, where 2/3 copies are retained for a predefined period.</p>
                <p class="lead">Switching over to SAP HANA<sup>&reg;</sup> will be like buying and moving into a new home. It will make sense for companies to go through their boxes of ‘old stuff’ prior to moving and decide what needs to be thrown away (deleted) and which data needs to be packed away in the garage, with archiving.</p>
                <p class="lead">Doesn’t it sound great to move into your new home without clutter and everything neatly organised in containers?</p>
